# Work Day Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app for scheduling your workday. It allows a user to update each hour of the work day with an item and save that entry to localstorage so that even with a page refresh the entry is restored. 

The current hour is displayed in red, with past entries in grey and future entries in green
